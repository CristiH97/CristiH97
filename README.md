### Hey there! 👋

I’m Cristian, a computer science graduate based in the Netherlands.

I enjoy building cool web apps and jumping between frontend and backend work.

If I have an idea, I usually turn it into a project.

Right now, I’m working on **PhotoVault** 📸, a photo-sharing app where users can upload, download, and share photos.

My main tech stack is **Laravel, Vue.js, JavaScript, and PHP**.  
Other tools I regularly use include **Python, Java, Git, AWS, and Figma**.

During my studies, I collaborated with companies on several projects. I like building things that are practical and actually used by real people.

Feel free to contact me for any questions, ideas, or collaboration opportunities.

### Fun facts:

- I enjoy strategy or puzzle games  
- I hate olives  
- GoT is my favorite series  
- Hobbies: tennis, building projects, gaming
